# Changelog

## 16.2.2 (build 17)

### App

**Watchlist & live prices**
* Live prices over WebSocket while the watchlist is open (Binance, Bybit, OKX,
  Coinbase, Kraken); REST stays the fallback. «LIVE» in the status pill, switch
  under Settings › Updates.
* Clear names for the two update modes: «Update frequently» (short intervals,
  also with the app closed, shows a notification) and «Live prices» (instant,
  only while the watchlist is open). No more «WebSocket» in the settings.
* Mini chart (24 h) per row, switched on under Settings › Watchlist (off on a new
  install); the % pill uses the same candles. Pulse line at the top
  («▲ 7 rising · ▼ 3 falling»).
* Tap opens the action sheet at once (no double tap), with a chart: 24 h / 7 d /
  30 d, candles or line, touch to read price and time.
* Swipe left to delete (with Undo), right for favorite; no star button any more:
  favorites keep the accent border and, with coin logos on, get a small star on
  the logo; jump button in long lists.
* Groups, a note per coin, second line «≈ value» in one of 31 currencies.
* Header with more room for groups: «All» as soon as there is one pair, no
  logo; bell and ⋯ menu on the right (logo and app name → About, Refresh,
  Sort, report). «+» (add pair) next to the search icon.
* «Something is happening right now» card can be hidden under Settings ›
  Watchlist; market alerts stay as they are.
* «Outdated» / «exchange not reachable» per row and in all widgets (after
  2 minutes with «Update frequently»).
* Watchlist widget: rows arrive together with the header (Android 12+), no
  more rows stuck on «Loading…»; updates with every refresh in the app.
* Start with one tap: the five largest coins with live prices, all preselected.
* BTC pairs show «1 CHF = n sats».

**Alarms**
* Alarm as a sentence: «When BTC goes above …» with a price suggestion,
  «Once / Every time», other conditions under «Advanced».
* One-tap templates: ±1 %, ±5 %, new 30-day high/low, volume ×3 (with Undo).
* Repeating price alarms fire only when the level is crossed and re-arm after a
  0.2 % move back.
* New conditions: move x % within y hours, volume spike, near the high/low of
  30 days / 90 days / 1 year (optionally new highs/lows only), gas price.
* Funding rate above/below x % and open interest change in 1/4/24 h for
  perpetuals on Binance, Bybit and OKX.
* Alarms in your currency (e.g. 60,000 EUR on a USDT pair).
* Portfolio alarms: total value above/below an amount, today's change up/down x %.
* Quiet hours, «Test alarm», choice of alarm sound; speech output queues
  several alarms and respects silent mode.

**«Why?» & market**
* «Why is this moving?» as a factor list (volume, market, volatility, open
  interest, distance to the 30-day high, funding, sentiment) with a short
  summary and how closely the coin follows Bitcoin.
* Unusual activity detection with adjustable sensitivity, optional notifications.
* Market tab in three sections: Crypto Pulse «What stands out», «Unusual
  today», Fear & Greed; market phase, dominance, altcoin season, halving; total
  market cap and volume, network fees (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB
  Chain, Bitcoin), cycle comparison, economic-calendar hint.
* «What stands out» now also shows market breadth («Top 30 ▲ 22 · ▼ 8»: how many
  of the 30 largest coins, without stablecoins, are up over 24 h) and the total
  crypto market cap with its 24 h change; a sentence only in clear cases (almost
  all rising/falling, or Bitcoin moving while most large coins don't follow). The
  widget shows the breadth next to Fear & Greed when there is room.
* Opens instantly from stored data; every row shows source and age, outdated
  values in a warning colour; «Context» and «Data» start collapsed (also on the first visit).
* Short explanations for funding rate, open interest, RSI and Pi cycle.

**Portfolio & privacy**
* Optional portfolio tab: buys and sells, average price, profit/loss, value
  history (7 d / 30 d / 1 y / since first buy), cut-off date export as CSV.
* Portfolio lock (biometrics or device passcode) for the portfolio only.
* «Hide amounts»: values shown as ••• in the portfolio, its widget and
  portfolio alarms; percentages stay visible.
* Portfolio widget: hourly prices for coins that are only in the portfolio
  (not on the watchlist) are loaded once an hour, so the value history no
  longer stays at «History coming soon»; with «today since 00:00» the chart
  starts at midnight and fills up over the day.
* Backups can be protected with a password (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2) and are
  interchangeable between Android and iOS. Android system backup now includes
  watchlist, alarms and settings.

**Widgets**
* New: portfolio widget (adapts to its size) and «What stands out» (Crypto
  Pulse); single-coin widget with candles or line and a 24 h / 7 d / 30 d range.
* Rounded corners, previews in the widget picker, compact rows with ▲/▼, a
  group per widget.
* Add a widget from inside the app (Android: pin, iOS: short guide).
* iOS: Live Activity for one pair on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island.
* Coin logos in the watchlist and single-coin widgets (own switch, see below).

**Coin logos**
* Real coin logos instead of letters: watchlist rows, action sheet header,
  portfolio, market cards, add-pair lists (iOS) and the watchlist and single-coin
  widgets. Round, fixed size, never at the expense of price or number columns; a
  light backing in dark mode keeps dark logos visible.
* Nothing bundled, nothing fetched one by one: logos come from CoinGecko
  (CoinMarketCap would need an API key). The app downloads the logos of all of the
  roughly 1,000 largest coins at once, then only new ones (symbol list at most
  weekly), and shows them only from the device (iOS: App Group, so widgets use them
  too). Gaps such as gold, silver and stocks are filled from the Binance website's
  public symbol list (unofficial; if it disappears, those keep their initials).
  Every install makes the same requests, so neither provider can tell which coins
  you follow.
* Without a logo (unknown coin, offline, error) the circle with the coin's initials
  appears — never a broken image. DEX pools always show initials, so a token that
  calls itself «BTC» never gets the Bitcoin logo.
* TradFi pairs (stocks, gold, FX) never take a CoinGecko logo, where a crypto token
  often uses the same ticker (CAT, NVDA): their logo comes only from the Binance
  list (tokenised stock such as NVDAB, futures-only entries), otherwise initials.
  Which pairs are TradFi comes from the exchange's pair list (loaded once if missing).
* With a switch off, that area shows neither logos nor initials (no empty
  placeholder).
* Three switches under Settings › Appearance › Coin logos: «In the app», «In the
  portfolio» and «In widgets». A new install has «In the app» and «In the portfolio»
  on (the watchlist shows logos right away), «In widgets» off; all off means nothing is
  loaded. Included in backups (Android ↔ iOS).

**Settings & navigation**
* Four tabs: Watchlist · Market · Portfolio (optional) · Settings. «Add pair»
  opens from «+» in the watchlist; no separate search tab.
* Tab bar: the chosen tab shows icon and name in the theme colour (no coloured pill behind
  it). New line icons in the style of «Market»: list with a small price line for Watchlist,
  coin stack for Portfolio – also everywhere else the portfolio is meant («Add to portfolio»,
  empty portfolio, portfolio alarms, widget help); Market and Settings unchanged.
* No welcome dialog: a new install goes straight to the starter selection;
  «What the app can do» under Settings › About.
* Settings in groups, with search (ignores accents and case, jumps to the item
  and highlights it); «Market notifications» and «Speech output» as sub-pages.
* The period next to the % change («24h», «today», «last update») is hidden by default;
  Settings › % change › «Show period next to the change» brings it back (watchlist pill,
  pulse line, single-coin widget, iOS Live Activity). Screen readers always say it.
* Settings: every single-choice page looks the same – a list where the chosen row is softly
  tinted in the accent colour with a check mark (mode, theme, price colours, % change basis,
  language, currency). Theme as a list with colour dots; currency as a list with search and
  the currency name in the app language (CHF Swiss franc); Android: language on its own page
  with search (iOS keeps the language in the iOS Settings app, as Apple intends).
* «FAV» chip next to «All» (always there): shows the favorites; a pair stays in its own group
  and appears under FAV as soon as it is a favorite. Also selectable for the watchlist widget.
* Settings › Watchlist › «Show names» (off by default): name under the pair, e.g. Bitcoin or
  NVIDIA, from the same lists as the logos (no extra request); TradFi pairs never get the name
  of a crypto token with the same ticker.
* Pair search understands exchange symbols: «BTCUSDT», «BTCUSDT Qtly 1225»,
  «BTCUSDT_261225», «BTCUSD_PERP», words like «Quartal»/«Perp»; order spot, perpetual,
  then quarterly contracts (nearest first).
* Futures on stocks, commodities, FX and pre-IPO companies (TradFi perpetuals) at
  Binance, Bybit, OKX, MEXC and Bitget, behind a switch under Settings › Watchlist
  (together with dated futures). New pairs without a chosen group go to
  «TradFi» or, for dated futures, «QTLY».
* Basis of the % change like Binance: last 24 h, since the last update, since 00:00 in
  the device time zone (with summer time) or since 00:00 in a fixed zone UTC+14 … UTC-12.
  Like Binance’s «Change(%) & Chart Timezone», the chosen zone also sets the times in the
  charts. «Since last update» compares the latest price with the previous one (watchlist,
  action sheet, widgets; close to 0 % with live prices); portfolio stays on 24 h.
* Settings › Updates (Android): battery usage moved to the bottom of the page.
* Android app shortcuts: Add pair, All alarms, Market.
* Questions, wishes and exchange requests via GitHub issues (link under About).

**Design & accessibility**
* New app icon (bell with a rising line) and five themes: Orange, Red, Blue,
  Green and Marrs Green, each with a matching icon. iOS: light, dark and tinted
  icons from the asset catalog.
* Price colours green/red or blue/orange, «Swap colours» (red = rising), high
  contrast mode; amounts in Rubik with equal-width digits.
* TalkBack and VoiceOver read every row, chart and widget as one sentence;
  Dynamic Type on iOS; Reduce Motion and right-to-left languages respected.
* 31 languages (Brazilian Portuguese added) with correct plural forms; readable
  width on Android tablets.
* Developer shown as r1AD.

**Reliability & performance**
* Android: the live service starts only from the visible app (not at boot),
  stops cleanly at the Android 15 time limit, and the background job pauses
  while it runs. Widgets are not redrawn per live tick while the screen is off.
* Fixed: Kraken symbols lost a leading X/Z (XTZ shown as «TZ»).
* iOS: alarms are notified only after saving, «60,000» is read correctly, the
  widget no longer checks alarms.
* Fewer requests: bulk tickers for the watched pairs only, Coinbase one request
  per pair; targeted widget redraws, chart image cache.
* Battery-optimisation hint only after the first alarm; delete everywhere with Undo.

**Tests & CI**
* Shared test cases for Android and iOS (`android/testdata/parity`): alarms,
  funding/open-interest alarms, threshold input, % change basis (incl. daylight
  saving), «no longer traded», 24 h change, outdated, live feed.
* iOS test target `CryptoCheckerTests`; Android instrumented core-flow test
  (`CoreFlowTest`, compiled in CI).
* Workflows: Android unit tests and build, translation check, iOS build and
  tests (manual), weekly economic-calendar update.

### Repository
* Complete source code of the Android and iOS apps published under the MIT
  License (`android/`, `ios/`); exchange guide moved to `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
* GitHub Actions: Android unit tests and debug build, translation check,
  iOS simulator build (manual).
* One shared change pill, switch row, loading placeholder and colour tokens on
  Android and iOS; iOS no longer redraws every tab when live prices are saved.
* CI: lint and unsigned release build as gates, dependency review on pull
  requests, Dependabot; iOS build and tests run automatically on iOS changes.
* Store texts, screenshot captions and app texts in all 31 languages
  reviewed for natural wording and consistent terms.
* Code split by responsibility, same file names on Android and iOS, no
  behaviour change: watchlist, action sheet and chart, add pair, market cards,
  settings, alarms, portfolio, widgets, price refresh (`PriceFetcher`,
  `DayReferences`, `RefreshEffects`), iOS `AppData` extensions. ViewModels stay
  one class per screen.

### Exchange library
* 15 new exchanges: WOO X (spot, futures), Deribit (futures), Phemex (spot,
  futures), Poloniex, One Trading, Upbit, Bithumb, bitFlyer, BtcTurk, Bitso,
  Indodax, ZebPay, Independent Reserve, LATOKEN, NonKYC.
* Now 41 markets on 32 exchanges plus DexScreener.
* Combined pair lists (LATOKEN, Independent Reserve) parsed in one request.
* Swift versions of all adapters for the iOS app.

### Privacy policy
* Lists all exchanges and data providers, exchange-rate sources (Frankfurter,
  ExchangeRate-API), network-fee providers, portfolio lock and portfolio widget.
* Also covers notes, portfolio transactions and cached market data stored on
  the device, and questions via GitHub issues.
* The apps contain no payment or donation feature.
* Coin logos: all logos of the largest coins downloaded at once from CoinGecko’s
  image servers, gaps (gold, silver, stocks) from Binance’s public symbol list
  (never one by one), shown from the device; one switch each for
  app, portfolio and widgets (all off = no requests).
